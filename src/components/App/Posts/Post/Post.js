      <h3>Cheers to my first post!</h3>
      <p>
        You are reading my 38,476<sup>th</sup> attempt to write a post for my
        first website I ever launched. Many, many repositories in Github are
        screaming at me to pick them up again, but none of them felt right. This
        one will be different (I hope), so, if you are reading this, then I did
        it!
      </p>
      <p>So, what should you expect?</p>
      <p>
        This is a place for my art: webpages, photography, and journaling
        ("blog" is used super loosely here) created from scratch. All the photos
        are taken on my Canon T3i. This webpage is created using the MERN Stack.
        The color palette was created with accessibility in mind, too!

      <p>Thank you for visiting! &heart;</p>
